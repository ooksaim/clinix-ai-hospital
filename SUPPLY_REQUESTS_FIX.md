# 🔧 FIXED: Persistent Supply Requests Issue

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**

- Approved supply requests were still showing in the pharmacist dashboard
- Requests were correctly marked as `'approved'` in the `supply_requests` table
- But they kept appearing in the "Supply Requests" tab of pharmacist dashboard

## 🎯 **Root Cause:**

The pharmacist API was using a database view (`pending_supply_requests`) that wasn't properly filtering out completed requests.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Updated Pharmacist Pending Requests API**

**File:** `/app/api/pharmacist/pending-requests/route.ts`

**Key Changes:**

```typescript
// OLD: Used potentially faulty view
.from('pending_supply_requests')

// NEW: Direct query with explicit filtering
.from('supply_requests')
.eq('request_status', 'pending')  // 🔥 KEY FIX: Only get pending requests
```

### **2. Enhanced Data Filtering**

- **Explicit Status Filter:** Only fetches requests with `request_status = 'pending'`
- **Real-time Updates:** When request is approved, it immediately disappears from pending list
- **Proper Joins:** Correctly joins with wards, pharmacy_stock, and user_profiles tables

### **3. Improved Logging**

```typescript
console.log(
  `✅ Found ${stats.total} pending requests (filtering out completed ones)`
);
```

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow Now:**

### **Step 1: Request Creation**

```
Ward Admin creates request
↓
Status: 'pending'
↓
Appears in Pharmacist Dashboard
```

### **Step 2: Request Approval**

```
Pharmacist approves request
↓
Status: 'pending' → 'approved'
↓
Stock transfer happens
↓
Request disappears from dashboard ✅
```

### **Step 3: Data Consistency**

```
✅ supply_requests table: status = 'approved'
✅ pharmacy_stock: decreased
✅ ward_supplies: increased
✅ pharmacy_transactions: logged
✅ pharmacist dashboard: request removed
```

## 🛡️ **Safeguards Added:**

1. **Status Verification:** Only pending requests are fetched
2. **Already Processed Check:** API prevents double-processing
3. **Stock Validation:** Ensures sufficient pharmacy stock
4. **Transaction Logging:** Complete audit trail maintained

## 🎯 **Result:**

**BEFORE:**

- ❌ Approved requests stayed in dashboard
- ❌ Confusing for pharmacists
- ❌ No clear status indication

**AFTER:**

- ✅ Only pending requests show in dashboard
- ✅ Approved requests automatically disappear
- ✅ Clear separation of pending vs completed
- ✅ Real-time status updates

## 🚀 **Testing the Fix:**

1. **Create Supply Request** (as Ward Admin)

   - ✅ Should appear in Pharmacist Dashboard

2. **Approve Request** (as Pharmacist)

   - ✅ Should disappear from dashboard immediately
   - ✅ Stock should transfer correctly
   - ✅ Transaction should be logged

3. **Check Database**
   - ✅ `supply_requests.request_status` = 'approved'
   - ✅ `pharmacy_stock.current_stock` decreased
   - ✅ `ward_supplies.current_stock` increased

**The persistent requests issue is now completely resolved!** 🎉
