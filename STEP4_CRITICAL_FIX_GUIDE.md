# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Database Schema Issues

## 🚨 The Problem

Your ward admin dashboard is failing because the database schema doesn't match what the APIs expect. Here are the specific issues:

### API vs Database Mismatches:

1. **ward_supplies table**: API expects `item_name` but database has `supply_name`
2. **wards table**: API expects `occupied_beds` column which doesn't exist
3. **supply_requests table**: API expects `requested_by_id` but database has `requested_by`
4. **supply_requests table**: API expects various column names that don't match

## 🎯 The Solution

### Step 1: Execute the Schema Update

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `STEP4_REAL_SCHEMA_UPDATE.sql` (just created)
4. Copy the entire content and paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the script

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After running the script, you should see:

- ✅ Ward bed counts properly calculated
- ✅ Sample ward supplies with correct column names
- ✅ Sample supply requests with proper relationships
- ✅ Sample admission requests to test the dashboard

### Step 3: Test the Dashboard

1. Go back to your ward admin dashboard: `/ward-admin`
2. Refresh the page
3. You should now see:
   - **Pending Admissions**: Sample admission requests
   - **Available Beds**: Real bed data with occupancy stats
   - **Supply Management**: Inventory with stock levels
   - **Supply Requests**: Pending supply requests

## 🔍 What the Script Does

### Database Updates:

- **Adds missing columns** to match API expectations
- **Creates automatic triggers** for real-time bed count updates
- **Inserts sample data** for immediate testing
- **Establishes proper relationships** between tables

### Sample Data Included:

- **4 Wards**: ICU, General, Emergency, Pediatric
- **10 Beds**: Mixed availability status
- **10 Supply Items**: Various medical supplies
- **3 Supply Requests**: Different priority levels
- **2 Admission Requests**: Pending approval
- **2 Sample Patients**: For admission testing

## 🎉 Expected Results

After the fix, your dashboard should show:

- **Pending Admissions: 2** (instead of 0)
- **Available Beds: 8** (instead of 0)
- **Low Stock Items: 0** (proper inventory)
- **Supply Requests: 3** (instead of 0)

## 🆘 If You Still Have Issues

1. **Check Supabase Logs** for any SQL execution errors
2. **Verify Tables** exist with correct columns
3. **Check API Endpoints** in browser developer tools
4. **Contact Support** if database permissions are restricted

**📝 Note**: This script is safe to run multiple times - it uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and `ON CONFLICT` to prevent duplicates.
